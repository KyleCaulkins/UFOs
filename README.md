# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana, a data journalist, build a html page about UFOs. Dana is looking to add to the excitement of McMinnville, Oregon's UFO enthusiast gathering. The site allows users to filter information from a table of UFO sightings, based on multiple criteria. This page is going to impress Dana's old friends and family who enjoy the unexplained.  

## Results
The front end of the web page can be used by opening the index.html file in a browser. The page should look like the following:

![Page_Overview](/Resources/overview.png)

By scrolling down and typing a date, city, state, country, or shape int to the "Filter Search" a user can filter the data table based on given criteria. The example below uses "fresno" in the city box and once the enter key is pressed, the data was filtered to only disply the UFO sighting in fresno.

## Summary
The final page is an astetically pleasing html site that can be used to find UFO observations. The users can filter the information based on date, city, state, country, and shape. Currently, the user is typing the information into the filter. An improvement for a future version of the site would be to have a drop down list, so the site is not relying on the user's ability to spell the variable they would like to find. A second suggestion would be to search for an API, or do some web scraping in order to keep the data fresh and relevant rather than having a static data set. Overall, the page is looking good and should be a fun addition to for the UFO enthusiast gathering.
